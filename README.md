# **Java Collections Repository**

This repository is dedicated to learning and practicing Java collections. It includes basic examples, exercises, and small projects to demonstrate the effective use of collections like
`ArrayList`, `HashMap`, `HashSet`, `TreeMap`, and more.

---

## **Contents**

### 1. **Basics**  
   A set of simple examples to demonstrate the core functionality of Java collections.  
   - Examples: `ArrayListDemo.java`, `HashMapDemo.java`, `TreeSetDemo.java`.

### 2. **Exercises**  
   Hands-on exercises to practice and reinforce concepts. Each exercise includes a problem statement and its solution.  
   - Example: Sorting a list of numbers, finding duplicate elements, or using collections to solve real-world problems.

### 3. **Projects**  
   Small-sized projects showcasing practical uses of collections in real-world scenarios.  
   - Examples: A Student Management System using `ArrayList`, Word Frequency Counter using `HashMap`.

### 4. **Utilities**  
   Common utility classes or functions to make working with collections easier.
